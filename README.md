# Logistic Regression:

```sh
Logistic Regression works on same concept of Linear Regression.
It is applicable when independent variable is continuous and the dependent variableis descrete such as (Yes,No).
Here X is independent variable and Y is dependent variable.
The output to be taken is descrete, we consider output in either 0 or 1.
For example if Y is descrete (Yes,No) then it will taken as (1,0)
      
```

## Performance Metrics:
```sh
Performance Metrics are help us in deciding whether model is good or not.
  1. Accuracy: 
                Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+FN+FP+TN)
          Out of total predicted values how many values are predicted correctly.
  2. Recall/TPR:
                  Recall= TP/(TP+FN)
          From all positives values ,how many are actually predicted as positives values.It is individual class Accuracy.
  
  3. Specitivity/TNR:
                   Specitivity = TN/(TN+FP)
           From all negative values how many are actually predicted as negative values.
  4. Precision:
                    Precision=TP/(TP+FP)
           From all predicted positives values, how many are actual positives values. It is individual class Stability.
  5. F1-score:
                    F1-score = 2*Recall*precision/(Recall+Precision)
           out of all observations how many are predicted incorrectly.
